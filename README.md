Design of protocol:
    1. (Relative stability) Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
        1.1 Chainlink price feed
        1.2 Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
    2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algotithmic (Decentralized)
        2.1 People can only mint the stablecoing with enough callateral (coded)
    3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
        3.1 wETH (ERC20 version)
        3.2 wBTC (ERC20 version)
